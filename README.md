Very simple C++ console app. Made in February in collaboration with Julia Kapica, Zuzanna Ruszy≈Ñska, Elene Kajaia and Nataliia Strelnikova for the first programming classes at Collegium da Vinci. We were not using GitHub then, which made the work much less efficient, but it gave us the basics of working in group of people.
