Very simple C++ console app. Made in February in collaboration with Julia Kapica, Zuzanna Ruszy≈Ñska, Elene Kajaia and Nataliia Strelnikova for the first programming classes at Collegium da Vinci. We were not using GitHub then - we were working on separate files and sharing them via Google Drive, which made the work much less efficient. However, it taught us the basics of working in group of people and importance of each member's collaboration. It was certainly one of the milestones we faced.
